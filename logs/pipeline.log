However, the provided HTML snippet seems to be incomplete and does not contain any input fields. 

If there were input fields, the process would involve:

1. Parsing the HTML to locate all `<input>` elements.
2. Extracting the `name` attribute from each input element to use as the key in the JSON object.
3. Constructing a CSS selector for each input element, which could be based on attributes like `id`, `class`, or `name`.

Since the HTML provided does not include any input fields, I cannot generate the JSON mapping as requested. If you have a complete HTML document or specific sections with input fields, please provide them, and I can help extract the necessary information.
